		"bodyHTML": "<p>CODY, Wyo., August 16 — Liz Cheney, former vice-president Dick Cheney’s eldest daughter, claimed victory late on Tuesday in Wyoming’s Republican primary race for the state’s lone US House of Representatives seat.</p><p>Unofficial early results by 10pm (0400 GMT) showed Cheney with 26,363 votes in the nation’s least populous state. State senator Leland Christensen was running a distant second, with almost 15,000 votes, while her six other Republican competitors each held fewer than 12,000 votes.</p><p>“I’m honoured by the trust Wyoming Republicans have placed in me to serve as our next representative in Congress,” Ms Cheney said in a statement.</p><p>The Casper Star-Tribune newspaper called the race late on Tuesday night.</p><p>Wyoming is a reliably red state, with the Republican primary winner all but assured of a general election victory in November.</p><p>Ms Cheney’s apparent victory comes two years after she launched an unsuccessful bid for a US Senate seat that saw her withdraw from the race early.</p><p>She drew criticism from some establishment Republicans two years ago when she ran against popular incumbent Senator Mike Enzi and was labelled a “carpetbagger” for having only recently established residency in Teton County, one of the country’s wealthiest districts, in a state widely populated by working-class miners, oil, and gas workers.</p><p>She said a family health crisis prompted her to withdraw.</p><p>Ms Cheney, 49, is a lawyer who worked in the US state department while her father was vice-president.</p><p>Her campaign has received strong financial support from former high-ranking government officials, such as former presidents George H.W. Bush and George W Bush, former defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former White House political adviser Karl Rove.</p><p>Ms Cheney campaigned as a “strong conservative voice for Wyoming”, promising to protect the state’s pivotal coal industry, defend gun rights, and generally work “to reverse President Obama’s devastating policies”.</p>",
