Others learnt from leaflets dropped from the skies. And some, like Layla’s parents, were only certain when they called their daughter, at a refugee camp miles away, to confirm that the blasts they heard in the distance meant <a href=\"/content/92dec32a-9528-11e6-a80e-bcd69f323a8b\">the battle to reclaim Mosul</a> from <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/isis\" title=\"Isis news headlines - FT.com\">Isis</a> had begun.</p><p>“When I told them, they were so excited. They said, ‘God willing, we will see you soon,’” says Layla, a frail woman in a faded, tattered dress who now lives in the Debaga camp in Iraq’s semi-autonomous northern Kurdistan region. She fled her home on the outskirts of Mosul just hours before the <a href=\"/content/7cf16d40-819d-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198\">military operation</a> to recapture Iraq’s second city began on Monday. </p><p>“Everyone in Mosul is now waiting for God’s mercy,” she says, throwing her hands up with a sigh.</p><p>Mosul, a centre of ancient cultures and trade that has seen empires come and go, was sealed off from the world in June 2014. Hundreds of jihadis stormed into the city as Iraqi soldiers melted away. The fight to recapture it will be the most symbolically important battle against Isis in the country. It brings together about 30,000 Iraqi and Kurdish troops and 5,000 American forces from the US-led international coalition to liberate a city where the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi announced his so-called caliphate. </p><p><img src=\"http://com.ft.imagepublish.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/38504a7e-97bb-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582\" alt=\"Map: The battle for Mosul\" width=\"600\" height=\"510\">Mosul’s fall triggered the swift <a href=\"/content/b2c6b5ca-9427-11e4-82c7-00144feabdc0\">expansion of Isis across northern Iraq and neighbouring Syria</a>, brought the Iraqi army to its knees and raised the spectre that this <a href=\"/content/92dec32a-9528-11e6-a80e-bcd69f323a8b\">fragmented country</a> might never be whole again.</p><p>A mix of excitement and dread is evident among residents who spoke to the Financial Times from inside the city — as well as their relatives, waiting on the outside. Internet and mobile phones are banned, so locals make furtive phone calls a few times a week to tell their family they are safe — or provide information about Isis movements to Iraqi officials who depend on their assistance. </p><p>Trust is scarce. “People can’t talk to each other about what’s going on — not the neighbours, no way. You cannot be sure who is an Isis informant,” says Layla, who like all Mosul residents interviewed, asked not to use her full name to protect her family. </p><p>No one can predict how long the fight to reclaim Mosul — home to 1.5m people — will take. (Isis launched an attack on <a href=\"/content/acd476f4-975c-11e6-a80e-bcd69f323a8b\">Kirkuk</a> yesterday, a reminder that it will not go quietly.) Even when it does fall, it is unclear what kind of city will emerge from the trauma of two years under brutal jihadi rule.</p><h3 class=\"ft-subhead\">‘No one could get out alive’</h3><p>Ahmed, 19, clings to a chain-link fence in an enclosed corner of the Debaga camp, east of Mosul. He and hundreds of other men who recently fled are waiting for Kurdish security officials to determine whether there are militants among them. Three days earlier, he says, he was in central Mosul to stockpile food, when he saw four men in orange jumpsuits forced to kneel in one of the squares. They were accused of using mobile phones.</p><img src=\"http://com.ft.imagepublish.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/aae1e68a-977d-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582\" longdesc=\"An Iraqi government soldier on the outskirts of Qayyarah\" alt=\"TOPSHOT - A member of the Iraqi government forces takes a position on top of a vehicle as smoke rises on the outskirts of the Qayyarah area, some 60 kilometres (35 miles) south of Mosul, on October 20, 2016, during an operation against Islamic State (IS) group jihadists to retake the main hub city.

There was blood from the executions everywhere,” he says.</p><p>Marwa, a therapist who fled earlier this year but left her parents behind in Mosul, says she is haunted by memories of a deep pit in Khifsah on the city’s outskirts, where Isis pushed people to their deaths. “If they didn’t die from the fall, they would leave them there to die, because no one could get out alive,” she says. “People living nearby deal with an unbearable smell that makes it hard to sleep, and some people had serious psychological problems.”</p><p>She works at displacement camps like Debaga, treating people arriving from Mosul with disorders ranging from night terrors to aggression or those who have become catatonic. Behind her, a traumatised elderly woman covered in dirt and scabs begins shouting: “Let them drop paratroopers into the city! Let them shell everything! Let them kill the civilians!

Residents counter by saying that the failure to intervene earlier is proof that the Shia majority-dominated government cares little about their fate. </p><p>The reality is far more complex. The fight for Mosul has raised impossible choices. One example was Baghdad’s decision to halt state salaries to Mosul last year so it could block the taxation of wages by Isis, which had meant it was essentially funding the jihadis. Cutting the salaries meant throwing thousands of civilians into economic suffering. </p><p>“The government treated us roughly. They ignored us, deprived us. We had no help,” says Abu Saad, who spoke to the FT by phone from inside Mosul and requested a pseudonym for his safety. “We want to welcome the army and the government, but we don’t think they see us as a part of them, as a part of Iraq.”</p><p><img src=\"http://com.ft.imagepublish.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/0dd6385e-977e-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582\" longdesc=\"A displaced woman and a child in front of a mural at the Deepaka camp northwest of Erbil\" alt=\"A displaced woman who fled from Islamic State militants in Mosul holds her baby at Deepaka camp in the northwest of Erbil, during an operation to attack Islamic State militants in Mosul, Iraq, October 20, 2016.

Erbil and Baghdad have put aside budget disputes and political squabbles to deploy their forces side by side. Iran-backed Shia militias, long seen as a destabilising factor, have stayed away from Mosul. They have, however, vowed to lead the campaign to capture the Nineveh town of Tel Afar, an area of majority Shia Turkmen and home town of some of the most notorious Isis commanders. Turkey has bristled at the prospect and threatens to intervene on behalf of the town’s Sunni Turkmen.</p><p>“Militarily, this is one of the largest collaborations since [the US-led invasion of Iraq in] 2003 . . . but this is a military battle without a political plan for what comes the day after,” says Renad Mansour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a think-tank. “It will be more difficult to negotiate a plan when they no longer have a common enemy, and the realpolitik sets in.”</p><p><img src=\"http://com.ft.imagepublish.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/d811f46a-977d-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582\" longdesc=\"Government forces on the back of a vehicle near Qayyarah\" alt=\"TOPSHOT - Iraqi forces sit in the back of a vehicle as troops advance through the desert on the banks of the Tigris river, northeast of the main staging base of Qayyarah, on October 20, 2016, during an operation against Islamic State (IS) group jihadists to retake the main hub city of Mosul.

The more we have contact, the more it helps the army advance,” he says. “They know where Isis gathers, what they are trying to target.”</p><p>Abu Saad, despite his bitterness towards Baghdad, is one of those informants. “Everyone is really hoping for an end to this — whoever wants to march in, we don’t care. We just have to hope they don’t act in sectarian revenge.” Whenever he can, he sneaks to a corner of his roof where he sometimes has coverage: Isis has knocked out most network towers. The mobile ban means he cannot buy phone credit, so friends outside the city transfer credit to him. The risks are so high, he says, even his wife does not know about his work. </p><p>“I worry we might start discussing it and the kids will hear and repeat something,” he says. “No one in Mosul can speak their mind to just anyone now.”</p><h3 class=\"ft-subhead\">‘The ones to die will be Isis’</h3><p>As Iraqi forces encircle the city, life in Mosul is becoming even harder. Abu Saad says Isis militants wear civilian clothes to avoid detection by US planes and are stepping up their efforts to identify informants. He reports that civilians in nearby villages have been forced out of their homes so houses can be searched for illicit mobiles and TV sets. Prices for staples such as rice have risen to about $40-$50 a kilo. Layla says her family has been eating only aubergines grown in their backyard, cooked once a day over a wood fire. “They can’t afford cooking gas, and we’ve forgotten what electricity is,” she says. </p><p><img src=\"http://com.ft.imagepublish.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/e9c1417a-977d-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582\" longdesc=\"A man surveys an oilfield blaze south of Mosul\" alt=\"TOPSHOT - A man stands in front of a fire from oil that has been set ablaze in the Qayyarah area, some 60 kilometres (35 miles) south of Mosul, on October 19, 2016, during an operation by Iraqi forces against Islamic State (IS) group jihadists to retake the main hub city.

And the ones to die will be Isis, not our residents,” says Ali Khdeir, a member of the Nineveh Council. </p><p>Many residents have died during the occupation and since the military operation began. Mohammad al-Bayati, the head of Nineveh council’s security committee, says there have been several botched revolts in recent days. In the village of Hawd, locals began to attack Isis fighters when security forces said they were approaching, only to find that the army was pinned down by hundreds of improvised explosives buried in the ground, and unable to reach them in time. Abu Saad recalls a friend who was shot in the head in his home along with several other men. “Right now, I’m mostly frustrated the operation is going so slowly. At this rate it will take them six months to take Mosul. We had hoped it would be done in days.”</p>",

And some, like Layla’s parents, were only certain when they called their daughter, at a refugee camp miles away, to confirm that the blasts they heard in the distance meant <a href=\"/content/92dec32a-9528-11e6-a80e-bcd69f323a8b\">the battle to reclaim Mosul</a> from <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/isis\">Isis</a> had begun.</p><p>“When I told them, they were so excited. They said, ‘God willing, we will see you soon,’” says Layla, a frail woman in a faded, tattered dress who now lives in the Debaga camp in Iraq’s semi-autonomous northern Kurdistan region. She fled her home on the outskirts of Mosul just hours before the <a href=\"/content/7cf16d40-819d-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198\">military operation</a> to recapture Iraq’s second city began on Monday. </p><p>“Everyone in Mosul is now waiting for God’s mercy,” she says, throwing her hands up with a sigh.</p><p>Mosul, a centre of ancient cultures and trade that has seen empires come and go, was sealed off from the world in June 2014. Hundreds of jihadis stormed into the city as Iraqi soldiers melted away. The fight to recapture it will be the most symbolically important battle against Isis in the country. It brings together about 30,000 Iraqi and Kurdish troops and 5,000 American forces from the US-led international coalition to liberate a city where the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi announced his so-called caliphate. </p><figure class=\"n-content-image\"><img src=\"http://com.ft.imagepublish.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/38504a7e-97bb-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582\" alt=\"Map: The battle for Mosul\" width=\"600\" height=\"510\"></figure><p>Mosul’s fall triggered the swift <a href=\"/content/b2c6b5ca-9427-11e4-82c7-00144feabdc0\">expansion of Isis across northern Iraq and neighbouring Syria</a>, brought the Iraqi army to its knees and raised the spectre that this <a href=\"/content/92dec32a-9528-11e6-a80e-bcd69f323a8b\">fragmented country</a> might never be whole again.</p><p>A mix of excitement and dread is evident among residents who spoke to the Financial Times from inside the city — as well as their relatives, waiting on the outside. Internet and mobile phones are banned, so locals make furtive phone calls a few times a week to tell their family they are safe — or provide information about Isis movements to Iraqi officials who depend on their assistance. </p><p>Trust is scarce. “People can’t talk to each other about what’s going on — not the neighbours, no way. You cannot be sure who is an Isis informant,” says Layla, who like all Mosul residents interviewed, asked not to use her full name to protect her family. </p><p>No one can predict how long the fight to reclaim Mosul — home to 1.5m people — will take. (Isis launched an attack on <a href=\"/content/acd476f4-975c-11e6-a80e-bcd69f323a8b\">Kirkuk</a> yesterday, a reminder that it will not go quietly.) Even when it does fall, it is unclear what kind of city will emerge from the trauma of two years under brutal jihadi rule.</p><h2 class=\"subhead subhead--standard\">‘No one could get out alive’</h2><p>Ahmed, 19, clings to a chain-link fence in an enclosed corner of the Debaga camp, east of Mosul.

The fight for Mosul has raised impossible choices. One example was Baghdad’s decision to halt state salaries to Mosul last year so it could block the taxation of wages by Isis, which had meant it was essentially funding the jihadis. Cutting the salaries meant throwing thousands of civilians into economic suffering. </p><p>“The government treated us roughly. They ignored us, deprived us. We had no help,” says Abu Saad, who spoke to the FT by phone from inside Mosul and requested a pseudonym for his safety. “We want to welcome the army and the government, but we don’t think they see us as a part of them, as a part of Iraq.”</p><figure class=\"n-content-image\"><img src=\"http://com.ft.imagepublish.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/0dd6385e-977e-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582\" longdesc=\"A displaced woman and a child in front of a mural at the Deepaka camp northwest of Erbil\" alt=\"A displaced woman who fled from Islamic State militants in Mosul holds her baby at Deepaka camp in the northwest of Erbil, during an operation to attack Islamic State militants in Mosul, Iraq, October 20, 2016.

They have, however, vowed to lead the campaign to capture the Nineveh town of Tel Afar, an area of majority Shia Turkmen and home town of some of the most notorious Isis commanders.
