The retailer went into administration earlier this year leaving future of its 11,000 staff in doubt and many of the 20,000 members of its pension scheme facing cuts to their retirement with the fund in need of a bailout estimated at £275m.</p><p>The flamboyant businessman’s appears in front of the parliamentary committee that last week heard a flavour of the internal feuding between management and new owners, including allegations a death threat was made against the chief executive and there plans to hive off assets before the retailer collapsed.</p><p>Key developments</p>Sir Philip said there is a plan “in motion” to resolve the BHS pension deficitIn a heated session, the retail entrepreneur avoided answering quite a lot of the detailed questionsBut he does admit “unfortunately” he sold BHS “to the wrong guy.”On several occasions during a near 6-hour hearing he accuses MPs on the committee of “bullying” himHe denies blocking a potential rescue bid by SportsDirect just before BHS collapsedHe hits out suggestions he was involved in tax avoidance and points out he and his companies have paid “hundreds of millions” in tax<p>By Mark Odell, Lauren Fedor, John Murray Brown and Lucinda Elliott</p>8:57amMark Odell<p>Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the latest installment of the parliamentary inquiry into the collapse of BSH.This morning will see the appearance, we think on his own, of Sir Philip Green, chairman of Arcadia, his retail empire, that sold the High Street retailer to a vehicle called Retail Acquisitions for £1 in March 2015. The vehicle was led by Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt with no retail experience. The chain collapsed just over a year later.</p>9:08amMark Odell<p>You may recall that the hearing last week produced quite a bit of drama with allegations. As Mark Vandevelde, the FT’s global retail correspondent, put it:</p><p>Last week, two parliamentary committees heard lurid allegations of diverted money, plots to carry off assets and a death threat to the chief executive after Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt with no retail experience, bought the business for £1 in 2015.</p>9:10amMark Odell<p>The FT’s chief political correspondent, Jim Pickard, who is at the hearing, tells us that there was a queue outside the building where the session is due to start in just over 5 minutes that was longer than when Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, appeared before MPs in a separate inquiry last week.</p>9:11amMark Odell<p>And this Tweet earlier from Oliver Shah, the Sunday Times retail correspondent, suggests MPs are planning to grill Sir Philip for quite some time. Normally, a session might last a couple of hours</p><p>https://twitter.com/olivershah/status/742969550409465856</p>9:21amMark Odell<p>It is worth reminding everyone of the tension between Sir Philip and one of the two MPs leading the inquiry – Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee. It started in early May when Frank Field suggested Sir Philip’s knighthood could be at risk if the retail tycoon did not pay £571m to close the gap in the BHS pension fund. Sir Philip responded by saying Frank Field should resign from the committee and then pushed back further by suggesting he would not attend the hearings unless Mr Field did go. He obviously backed down.</p>9:24amMark Odell<p>The hearing has started and Sir Philip has begun by assuring MPs he will tell the truth, describing how he started out in his youth working his way up. He describes hi strong emotional ties to BHS but admits: “I can’t make everybody happy”</p>9:26amMark Odell<p>The FT’s Lauren Fedor, sitting next to me, has more key quotes from Sir Philip’s opening comments:</p><p>If I have done something wrong, I am happy to say I have done something wrong.</p><p>I don’t tell lies.</p><p>I just want to apologise to all of the BHS people.</p>9:28amMark Odell<p>This from the FT’s Jim Pickard who is in the hearing after battling through a “fierce” queue: apparently there will be an overspill room elsewhere on the premises.</p><p>Today’s appearance by Sir Philip Green marks one of the most eagerly-awaited visits to a select committee since Rupert Murdoch turned up at the height of the phone hacking scandal.It caps a remarkable few days in which MPs have also grilled Mike Ashley, the rival retail billionaire, and Dominic Chappell, the former racing driver who owned BHS at the point of its collapse.</p><p>Today’s appearance is in front of a “joint committee” made up of MPs from the business select committee (chaired by Iain Wright) and the work &amp; pensions select committee (chaired by Frank Field).</p><p>Sir Philip will face tough questions over how he came to sell BHS for £1 to Mr Chappell and thus walk away from the ailing business and its pension black hole.This from Jim Pickard, the FT’s chief political correspondent, who battled through hordes to get into the room:</p><p>Until a few days ago it looked as if Sir Philip might not even attend – in protest at the antagonistic remarks made by Mr Field, an independent-minded Labour veteran.</p><p>The caustic Mr Field, who was a DWP minister under Tony Blair’s first government in 1997, had said last week that he would “laugh” if the tycoon offered less than £600m to settle BHS’s pension debts. That prompted Sir Philip to call for his resignation.</p><p>“I am not prepared to participate in a process which has not even the pretence of fairness and objectivity and which has as its primary objective the destruction of my reputation. I therefore require you to resign immediately from this inquiry,” he said.</p><p>I’ve also picked up that the tycoon may yet offer to make a new contribution towards the BHS pension deficit. Some MPs suspect, however, that his willingness to do so has been marred by Mr Field’s supposed grandstanding.</p><p>Meanwhile there are rumblings about whether Sir Philip’s knighthood could be in jeopardy if he fails to make adequate amends for the BHS pensioners. Some anonymous Tory MPs have threatened to write to the forfeiture committee, which has the ability to evaluate the knighthood and advise the Queen on subsequent action.</p><p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell recently said that the retail magnate should be stripped of his knighthood if he refused to appear today. “The fact he feels he can threaten to subvert parliament is an insult to the British public,” he recently wrote.</p>9:29amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip is being asked about the early days of BHS:</p><p>In the early days the financing of BHS was extremely conservative. It was very conservatively done</p><p>You go ask any banker and [...] they would say ‘why were you being so conservative?’</p>9:31amMark Odell<p>Jim Pickard said that Sir Philip walked into the committee room earlier alongside Frank Field, adding:</p><p>The tycoon is very sun-tanned as per usual and is stroking his stubbled chin repeatedly. He is alone in front of the committee.</p>9:34amMark Odell<p>The questioning is now focused on a couple of properties that were sold by BHS to another investment vehicle some years ago. As always in these hearings, the MPs are pursuing certain lines of inquiry and it’s not always clear where they are going with their questions. But at the moment they appear to be trying to identify who owned the vehicle, called Carmen, that bought the properties.</p><p>100 per cent of the funds (£106m) were paid back to BHS</p><p>adding Carmen was “a family company”</p>9:36amMark Odell<p>A bit more detail on the questioning on the sale and lease back property deals involving a company he controlled, from the FT’s John Murray Brown.</p><p>He admits a number of BHS properties were purchased by a company called Carmen, but it was conducted based on an external valuation. He said 100 per cent of the proceeds were paid into BHS. “There were no special circumstance.This was a typical sale and lease back situation.”</p>9:39amMark Odell<p>The MPs are probing him on the “complex structure” of his company and its offshore ownership. Sir Philip says “it is not complex at all” and then hits out when it is suggested that he is involved in “tax avoidance”.</p><p>“I don’t accept that at all,” he says, adding that many companies use those structures.</p>9:42amMark Odell<p>He has also been asked why he chose to move to Monaco in 1998:</p><p>I left here in 1998 because of a heart scare, for personal reasons.</p><p>Then he went on to explain that his wife Lady Tina Green and his children remained in Monaco: “When I came back here in 2000, my family, my children remained out of the country. My children remained in school overseas for the next 12 years.”</p><p>Lady Tina is the owner of her husband’s UK interests.</p>9:45amMark Odell<p>The FT’s Jim Pickard has just sent this observation:</p><p>In case you want to know who is asking Sir Philip questions about his business at the moment? Why, it’s none other than Michelle Thomson, who the SNP expelled last year over “irregularities” in property deals she was involved in. She is now an independent MP.</p>9:46amMark Odell<p>The FT’s John Murray-Brown adds on the questioning about BHS’ offshore ownership:</p><p>The committee is quizzing him now about a company called Mildenhall. He is asked how transparent the structure he set up for BHS was.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s complex at all, everybody knows the company is owned offshore. It’s not hidden.”Quizzed about the ownership of BHS, Sir Philip says: “I’ve never had an overseas bank account.”With Sir Philip giving a defence of the offshore structure of the ownership he is interrupted by Frank Field, chair of the works and pension committee. “It is the British Home Stores ( we are talking about), it is not as though it is a foreign entity”.</p>9:53amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip has just had a go at Richard Fuller, one of the Conservative MPs on the committee, interrupting comments he was making about how he found BHS when he first took it over in 2000.</p><p>Do you mind not looking at me like that all the time?</p>9:54amMark Odell<p>The FT’s Jim Pickard has more on that bizarre aside:</p><p>Sir Philip just told an MP to stop staring at him in a “disturbing” way.</p><p>He is referring to Richard Fuller, a Conservative critic who recently called Sir Philip the “unacceptable face of capitalism”.</p>9:56amMark Odell<p>It has to be said that extraordinary intervention sums up the dynamics of the hearing at the moment – Sir Philip is bossing the MPs</p>9:58amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip is asked why his focus moved off BHS after he bought the chain in 2000:</p><p>In 2002 when we acquired Arcadia it took our total UK stores to 2,300. After this my time got split</p>10:08amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip is once again inviting MPs to come visit his Arcadia operation in central London.</p><p>However this ends… I think you should come and visit my building[...] That is a very well run machine. This isn’t made up”</p>10:10amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip says the reason he wants MPs to visit Arcadia is so they can sit down with his finance team there, adding:</p><p>I wouldn’t even know where to phone to get money out of our bank.</p>10:14amMark Odell<p>More from the FT’s Jim Pickard about Sir Philip’s performance so far:</p><p>Sir Philip is trying to stamp his mark on the committee of 11 MPs: “You can write this down,” he says at one point, patronisingly.</p><p>Criticised by Richard Fuller, the Conservative MP who he had a go at earlier, he responds: “if it was easy everyone would be doing it…maybe in your next career you should do retail?”</p>10:17amMark Odell<p>The questioning is now moving to BHS’s pension fund. Just a reminder that this is what the FT reported on June 13:</p>10:18amMark Odell<p>And here is what happened to the BHS pension fund as it moved into deficit over more than a decade:</p>10:20amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip has this to say about the pension fund:</p><p>You can’t run businesses of this size purely by yourself. I was not actively involved in pension conversations.</p>10:22amMark Odell<p>He continues to be pushed on his accountability for the pension fund and he is getting defensive:</p><p>I was not in charge at any point of the pension fund, I was not a trustee, I was not in the room . . .</p>10:23amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip does not like this line of questioning:</p><p>I think it is unfair and unreasonable to attack me when I can’t respond . . . .</p>10:24amMark Odell<p>He adds:</p><p>“I have not run away . . . ”</p><p>and is now complaining about the “outrageous press” coverage, which is “pretty rude”.</p>10:25amMark Odell<p>He has pushed back on the pension and suggests the committee account is unfair:</p><p>We put back £750m. Everyone wants to ignore that.</p>10:27amMark Odell<p>The FT’s Jim Pickard and some of his fellow journalist in the room appear to have drawn the ire of the “King of Retail”:</p><p>Sir Philip glares at us parliamentary hacks as he accuses us of “outrageous” and “pretty rude” coverage of his activities. “I have not run away, I have not tried to run away (from pension liabilities)” he says.</p>10:31amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip insisted he didn’t have an intimate involvement in the pension issue. “Ma’m” he says, referring to one of the female committee members, “I wasn’t involved in it. You can ask me as many questions as you like. This was not on my table.”</p>10:35amMark Odell<p>But then he suddenly changes tack and appears to apologise after he is asked how he can reconcile his lack of accountability for the pension deficit with an earlier statement that he was responsible for every aspect of the company. He insists he is not trying to blame anyone else, but says if the pension trustees had come to him and his executives and asked for a further injection, it would “have been a 5 minute conversation.”</p>10:35amMark Odell<p>This from the FT’s pensions correspondent, Josephine Cumbo:</p><p>https://twitter.com/JosephineCumbo/status/743011796773183489</p>10:37amMark Odell<p>More from the FT’s John Murray Brown:</p><p>Sir Philip says he’s a big boy. “What I want to avoid this morning, I’m a big boy, is to blame anyone else.”</p><p>On the pension deficit, he says: “Someone was asleep at the wheel”. On the pension, he says “What I’m saying is we can’t trade back.” He said the situation with the pension was “beyond sad and ridiculously stupid.”</p>10:40amMark Odell<p>It’s not all going Sir Philip’s way, the water is giving the retail entrepreneur a hard time:</p><p>https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/743002516523192320</p>10:43amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip has raised a chuckle among MPs, says the FT’s Jim Pickard:</p><p>Laughter in the room as sir Philip asks Labour MP if she was a mind-reader in a former life: “I might have been,” she says.</p><p>He is indignant at the idea that he ought to remember the details of meetings from half a decade ago. “You have such a wonderful memory…come and work for me.”</p>10:45amMark Odell<p>I should point out that it is not just the water giving Sir Philip a hard time, the questioning from MPs is certainly making him uncomfortable at times</p>10:48amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip has just been asked some very detailed questions about the pension scheme and he fires back:</p><p>You are asking me questions I can’t answer</p><p>He then goes on to say there have been some “horrible, horrible mistakes made” and again suggests the trustees have some responsibility . . .</p>10:51amMark Odell<p>Much of the questioning is around the pension recovery plan agreed in 2012, which involved a £10m annual payment to plug the deficit.</p>10:55amMark Odell<p>The nitty-gritty questioning on pensions has Sir Philip very much on the backfoot, including a suggestion he is “being bullied” by the MPs. As the FT’s Josephine Cumbo observes:</p><p>https://twitter.com/JosephineCumbo/status/743018504257961985</p>10:56amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip is urging MPs to allow him to “basically talk to you on the pension issue” and insists MPs are not allowing him to do so. He is objecting to specific questions</p>10:57amMark Odell<p>As the FT’s Jim Pickard observes from the hearing:</p><p>Incredulity in the room that the famously rumbustious Green is accusing one mild-mannered Tory MP, Richard Graham, of “beating me up” and bullying. The softly-spoken Graham was only asking factual questions about a meeting with former pension minister Steve Webb.</p>11:00amMark Odell<p>One of Sir Philip’s main bone of contention is the assertion of former pensions minister Steve Webb, who told MPs that Sir Philip had assured him in 2012 that there was “no risk” of the BHS pension fund falling to the Pension Protection Fund. The FT reported that on 13 June.</p><p>In summary: in a letter to Frank Field, chair of the work and pensions committee, published earlier this week, Webb said Sir Philip had reassured him that funds for the BHS pension scheme “would be found elsewhere” in the event that the retail chain went bust.</p><p>But Sir Philip just told MPs: “I do not recall what got said at that meeting.”</p><p>Sir Philip added that Arcadia finance director Paul Budge also had a “different” recollection of the meeting.</p>11:02amMark Odell<p>More from the FT’s pensions correspondent:</p><p>https://twitter.com/JosephineCumbo/status/743019289201016832</p>11:08amMark Odell<p>A reminder that Margaret Downes, the former chair of the BHS pension trustee board, has said a 23-year recovery plan agreed for the scheme’s deficit was considered unusually long. She told MPs at the end of May that from the “very beginning” of talks with BHS, trustees were told that the maximum amount that would be paid to address the deficit was £10m a year.</p><p>Months after the 2012 rescue plan was submitted to the Pensions Regulator, BHS presented an alternative rescue plan, known as Project Thor, to the trustee board.</p><p>Here’s the full story</p>11:09amMark Odell<p>This from the FT’s Lauren Fedor:</p><p>Sir Philip has just told MPs the BHS pension scheme is “resolvable” and “sortable”, telling MPs, “We will find a solution.” Sir Philip said plans are “in motion” with the Pensions Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund. “I am there to sort this in the correct way,” he said.</p><p>But Sir Philip did not let the Pensions Regulator off lightly. At one point, he singled out Pensions Regulator chief executive Lesley Titcomb, saying she had never placed a phone call or sent an email to Arcadia.</p>11:16amMark Odell<p>He adds that his team was contacted directly by the regulator last week.“Maybe somebody bought them a telephone,” he quipped.</p>11:20amMark Odell<p>On the ability of Retail Acquisitions, the vehicle that Arcadia sold BHS to for £1:</p><p>https://twitter.com/JosephineCumbo/status/743023445437468673</p>11:21amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip is trying to keep the focus on the plan that he says is now in place “to find a solution” to the pensions deficit and is avoiding answering questions about what happened in the past. He makes the point that the pension regulator is now in close contact:</p><p>They phoned up saying they would be interested in having a meeting. There have been two or three calls over the last 7 days [...] ever since they heard about me coming here today.. Little bit of a coincidence?”</p>11:23amMark Odell<p>It appears the old rescue plan, Project Thor, which referred to in a post at 11:08am, is being dusted off, Sir Philip reveals:</p><p>We are currently working on, as we speak, an updated Project Thor. They are a week, a few days, a week away, from making a presentation for what the latest numbers are.</p>11:28amMark Odell<p>There is a break coming up and Frank Field has just chided another member of the committee for “going on to somebody else’s questions” – Sir Philip is mixing ultra-defensive mode, with attack mode:</p>11:33amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip keeps using the defense that he can’t know everything that has gone on and explains to MPs that he can’t possible know about all the documents they keep quoting from. “I don’t write all these letter . . . this a very big machine”- referring to Arcadia – and has now started talking about a “hub” the company is planning to build in Singapore and a new building in the West End the company is building . . . “I don’t go to all these meetings . . .”</p><p>He is reminded by the committee of the accountability of directors as one of the MPs suggests that by not answering the questions it raises issues of corporate governance</p>11:35amMark Odell<p>Sir Philip is now trying to supplant the chairman of the committee (or co-chairmen as this is a joint committee) by calling for the break. He doesn’t get his way and the questioning continues about pensions. It’s getting a bit tense and his current questioner Jeremy Quin, one of the Conservative MPs, rolls his eyes.</p>11:41amMark Odell<p>Jeremy Quin has now moved on to the options facing Sir Philip when he sold BHS . . . Sir Philip has insisted that he needs a break before dealing with that issue. It looks like he has almost got his way. One final question about the Lord Grabiner, the chairman of Taveta, the investment vehicle controlled by Sir Philip, who Frank Field, suggests “didn’t turn up” for a crucial meeting during the BHS sales process and didn’t ask for the papers. Sir Philip says he won’t answer for Lord Grabiner but suggest he must have had a good reason. And now we go to the break . . .</p>11:58amMark Odell<p>Right and we’re back on. The line of questioning now is around what happened around the sale of BHS to a vehicle called Retail Acquisitions for £1 in March 2015. The vehicle was led by Dominic Chappell, a former bankrupt with no retail experience.</p>12:01pmMark Odell<p>Last week, Mr Chappell told MPs he had struck an initial deal with Sir Philip that would have freed him from any pension obligations. When asked about that deal just now, Sir Philip said: “It’s not true.”</p>12:02pmMark Odell<p>Jim Pickard has some colour about what happened during the break:</p><p>Sir Philip and Frank Field were just having a brief conflab outside the men’s toilets. The contrast between them is acute: the aggressive, celebrity-loving billionaire and the ascetic, faintly pious MP for Birkenhead, one of the poorest seats in the country.</p>12:03pmMark Odell<p>Just before the hearing restarted, Jim Pickard reports that Frank Field poured a glass of water for the retail tycoon. Nice touch as Sir Philip was having trouble with that earlier – see our post at 10:40am</p>12:04pmMark Odell<p>More from Jim Pickard:</p><p>During the break I asked Tory MP Richard Graham – labelled a bully by Green – if he had had similar accusations before. Only when he wouldn’t let his son get a motorbike, he said. Graham says he went to bed at 5am last night after working on his preparation for the hearing.</p>12:06pmMark Odell<p>The questioning is moving and Sir Philip has now resorted to checking with each MP that asks him something if he can call them by their first name. So far no-one has objected.</p>12:09pmMark Odell<p>MPs are now asking Sir Philip about Paul Sutton, a convicted fraudster who approached Sir Philip’s Arcadia in 2013 about buying BHS. Sir Philip says he “disengaged” with him after an “anonymous file” about Sutton landed on his desk.</p>12:11pmMark Odell<p>He is having a back and forward about exactly when this file arrived as there seems to be a discrepancy about when Sir Philip stopped talking to Sutton. Sir Philip’s defence is that he can’t recall exactly when the file came to his attention.</p>12:12pmMark Odell<p>More details on that exchange about Sutton from the FT’s Lauren Fedor:</p><p>Sir Philip said he was introduced to Mr Sutton by City banker Robin Saunders, who had helped Sir Philip with the funding to first buy BHS back in 2000. Mr Sutton, like Sir Philip’s family, also resided in Monaco. But Sir Philip said he had not met Mr Sutton before Ms Saunders’s introduction. Sir Philip went on to tell MPs that he cut ties with Mr Sutton after he received an anonymous file “with a whole lot of stuff about Paul Sutton”. Sir Philip said he called Arcadia finance director Paul Budge and said “I don’t think this is a guy we should be engaging with.”</p>12:15pmMark Odell<p>He is now being asked when he became aware that there was a link between Sutton and Mr Chappell. “To be perfectly honest with you I don’t know when that came about but when it did come about there was some actions taken to make sure that wasn’t the case.”</p>12:19pmMark Odell<p>Sir Philip is on the defensive as he is being pushed on why he didn’t know where Mr Chappell “came from”. He says that a “gatekeeper” was appointed so that he did not have any contact with Mr Chappell until the deal was “cleared”.</p>12:23pmMark Odell<p>Sir Philip has just explained to MPs, “I try and avoid email�, he adds:“I play around with that and don’t get into trouble,” brandishing a Nokia flip-phone.Sir Philip told the FT last year that he had two Nokia 6310 mobile phones – one for incoming and one for outgoing calls, and said he prefers phone or face-to-face contact to email. You can read that interview here.</p>12:31pmMark Odell<p>Sir Philip has just read out a congratulatory email that he says was sent from Anthony Gutman, co-head of UK investment banking at the US investment bank, to Mr Chappell, on closing the deal. Sir Philip says that was the last of 90 emails. Mr Gutman has previously told MPs he had warned a close lieutenant of Sir Philip Green that the Mr Chappell had a history of bankruptcy. Goldman Sach’s role in the transaction remains one of interest as the they were never paid as advisors on the BHS deal, yet still acted for Sir Philip</p>12:39pmMark Odell<p>Sir Philip has told MPs that he was never told by anyone not to deal with Mr Chappell.</p><p>Asked if he would have done the deal if Mr Chappell had not passed Goldman Sach’s “sniff test”, he replied:</p><p>One million percent we would not have done business with him if they would have said “don’t deal with this guy” . That would have been the end of it, that was not the advice we got.</p>12:42pmMark Odell<p>Earlier, Sir Philip suggested law firm Olswang and professional services firm Grant Thornton were to blame, saying he went ahead with the deal after taking “comfort” that the firms were advising Mr Chappell.</p><p>But Sir Philip said he later heard that one of the firms had “bid for the business blind”, adding: “They didn’t know him from a hole in the wall.”</p>12:44pmMark Odell<p>This aside from the FT’s Jim Pickard:</p><p>Iain Wright may not be a familiar face to FT readers but he is building a reputation as chair of the business committee – previously something of a Parliamentary backwater.</p><p>He is switching easily between banter with Sir Philip and tough questions about how his reputation is now going “through the mud.”</p><p>Mr Wright is a former junior minister under Gordon Brown’s twilight New Labour government and an ex-flat mate of deputy leader Tom Watson.</p><p>In the Corbyn era, moderate ambitious Labour MPs are finding new ways to raise their profile: for example on select committees.</p>12:53pmMark Odell<p>Sir Philip is getting increasingly aggressive with the committee, telling one MP, Jeremy Quinn: “No good you looking at me like that. Put your glasses back on. You look better with your glasses”</p><p>He then demands another MP withdraws a statement and then raises his voice at a third.</p>12:56pmMark Odell<p>The MPs are firing different questions at Sir Philip now, the latest one is back to the reputation of Lord Grabiner, the Labour peer and Taveta chairman, the investment vehicle controlled by Sir Philip,w ho admitted previously he was not intimately involved with the sale of BHS. Asked if the thinks Lord Grabiner is a good chairman he replies: “Yes”.</p>12:57pmMark Odell<p>As the FT’s Lauren Fedor observes:</p><p>It’s getting personal. Business select committee chair Iain Wright just told Sir Philip Green he seems like a “very dominant personality”.</p><p>Sir Philip replied: “Well there is 10 of you and one of me.”</p><p>Wright went on to say Sir Philip that he seemed “extraordinarily thin-skinned” when being questioned.</p><p>The grilling has been going on for nearly four hours.</p>12:59pmMark Odell<p>We have lost count of the number of times Sir Philip has now apologised for selling BHS to Mr Chappell. Here’s one:</p><p>Did we go out of our way to find somebody to end up where we ended up, hopefully three hours in, you can accept that was not our intention. What happened is beyond horrible, sad. Unfortunately we found the wrong guy.</p>1:02pmMark Odell<p>He is asked why he felt “comfort” that the Mr Chappell’s investment vehicle had £120m of working capital. “I felt there was a plan in place, which if implemented and it was going to take a year, 18 months, it should have become profitable 18 months in.” He said “you didn’t want to receive a phone call” 18 months in that the business was in trouble.</p>1:07pmMark Odell<p>Sir Philip has one again resorted to answering “I don’t know” when he is asked by the committee whether he could explain why Goldman Sachs would ok the term sheet detailing the working capital that Mr Chappell’s vehicle had access to when on closer inspection it “looked more like £40m” instead of £120m</p>1:09pmMark Odell<p>Jim Pickard has just seen the time and thinks he has proof that at least one MP on the committee wasn’t aware the hearing was going to go on for so long:</p><p>This session is heading for four hours, longer than MPs were anticipating: How do we know this? I had been due to meet one of them for a coffee at 1pm.</p>1:10pmMark Odell<p>We would remind you that earlier this morning Oliver Shah of the Sunday Times spotted it could be a long session:</p><p>https://twitter.com/olivershah/status/742969550409465856</p>1:19pmMark Odell<p>Sir Philip Green is apparently keen to distance himself from the Dellals, a wealthy property investor family who loaned £35m to Dominic Chappell just before his Retail Acquisitions vehicle bought BHS.</p><p>Allied Commercial (ACE), a group controlled by Guy and Alexander Dellal, gave Chappell a £35m advance in March 2015, which Retail Acquisitions used to buy Marylebone House, BHS’s headquarters, which was owned by Sir Philip at the time.</p><p>To make matters more complicated, the Dellals are the son and grandson of a property entrepreneur who was an early backer of Sir Philip.</p><p>All that said, Sir Philip has denied he had anything to do with the £35m advance, telling MPs: “We had no connection to that money.”</p><p>MPs first heard last month that ACE played a crucial role in the March 2015 sale of BHS to Retail Acquisitions.</p><p>“He had managed to put £35m in a bank within about three days — I think it was something like that — which showed credibility,” Chris Harris, property director at Sir Philip’s Arcadia Group, told MPs in May.</p>1:22pmMark Odell<p>Sir Philip is getting a little tetchy under cross examination from Jeremy Quin. “There are 30m documents. If we say we’ve got it, you’ll get it. What’s the drama?”</p><p>He is now telling MPs to “lighten up” after being pulled up on his attitude towards the committee – things are heating up.</p>1:37pmMark Odell<p>The exchange between Sir Philip and MP Jeremy Quin is taking some time as the two men have a drawn out exchange around the cash flow in the BHS accounts and the guarantees agreed ahead of and in the months immediately after the deal. Sir Philip is taking Mr Quin through a detailed breakdown of the financing, they appear to be agreeing to disagree. If we can unpick the exchange we will.</p>1:42pmMark Odell<p>Sir Philip is now telling MPs he did not know about the fees Mr Chappell ran up in doing the deal. He adds that he has only realised in recent weeks that Mr Chappell borrowed the £5m Mr Chappell was meant to put in as equity as part of the deal by borrowing against the value of a BHS warehouse. “Whether that is legal I don’t know,” he tells MPs.</p>1:45pmMark Odell<p>Hang on, we’re having another break, four and a half hours in, so MPs can go off and vote. Sir Philip asks what there is left to discuss and is told by Iain Wright, the co-chair of the joint committee, that he will be dealing with issues including the last-minute talks to save BHS before it collapsed in late April. Sir Philip replied: “That should be fun.”</p>2:01pmMark Odell<p>And we’re back . . . . .</p>2:03pmMark Odell<p>The questioning hasn’t quite moved on yet to the collapse of BHS, Sir Philip and Jeremy Quin are still having exchanges on the ins-and-outs around the deal closing and the ongoing relationship between BHS and Arcadia, which was still providing services to the high street retailer.</p>2:06pmMark Odell<p>And now we are moving on to the sale. Sir Philip is being reminded by Richard Fuller MP, that he had previously said that perhaps he had had “too strong an emotional tie” to BHS. He is being asked if he had ensured BHS was left with enough cash in the business when he sold it. “I think they were given sufficient funds to take this business forward if they had gone on with the plan,” Sir Philip tells MPs.</p>2:20pmMark Odell<p>Sir Philip is now being asked about what relationship he had with Mr Chappell after the sale. He says there was some contact, but he never went back into the stores after March 11 2015, the day that BHS was sold.Sir Philip added that Mr Chappell and his team should have proceeded with the planned Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), which BHS’s landlords had signed up to, and would have provided with sufficient funding. “If the funding would have been achieved within the CVA, the business doesn’t go into administration, the rest of the cards don’t fall,” Sir Philip said.</p>2:24pmMark Odell<p>Hold on, the FT’s pensions correspondent has some reaction from Chris Martin, chair of the BHS pension scheme trustees:</p><p>https://twitter.com/JosephineCumbo/status/743069465311612928</p><p>https://twitter.com/JosephineCumbo/status/743069722623791104</p><p>https://twitter.com/JosephineCumbo/status/743069858817056768</p>2:28pmMark Odell<p>After more than five hours now, Sir Philip is keen to get to the end of this hearing . . . he is probably not the only one</p>2:46pmMark Odell<p>And we have now moved on to a possible bid by SportsDirect. Sir Philip initially says his knowledge of Mike Ashley’s, founder of SportDirect, interest in buying BHS was “zero” following claims by Mr Chappell that Sir Philip blocked Mr Ashley’s rescue bid for BHS.</p><p>Iain Wright, the co-chair, is now reading from a letter from Mike Ashley, owner of SportsDirect, in which Mr Ashley says he talked to Sir Philip over the weekend before administrators were called in to BHS.</p><p>Sir Philip confirms conversations by phone with Mr Ashley, who he describes as “a friend”, but insists that was the first he knew of Mr Ashley’s involvement. He says Mr Ashley told him that he was not involved in the details of the discussion with Mr Chappell. Sir Philip told MPs Mr Chappell was planning to sell BHS to SportsDirect for £1.</p><p>“As far as we were concerned I tried, contrary to what you were told . . .,” Sir Philip adds. Asked by Mr Wright what blocked the deal, Sir Philip pulled out a chequebook from his jacket and replies: “One of these . . .”</p><p>But he adds he doesn’t know what happened after that because he was “taken out of the process”.</p>2:47pmMark Odell<p>Sir Philip has just taken exception to being told by Iain Wright that it was his ego that blocked the SportsDirect deal to save BHS. “You owe me an apology for that, I have sat here for six hours and I haven’t been rude to you.”</p>2:48pmMark Odell<p>Sir Philip adds: “I wanted that deal to happen.”</p>2:50pmMark Odell<p>Frank Field has now asked him if the pension issue was resolved would he buy back BHS – this is after Sir Philip said he had considered saving BHS himself. His answer is: “No, life have moved on, it’s too late”</p><p>Mr Field reminds him of the 11,000 employees . . . Sir Philip says he hopes they can move on.</p>2:55pmMark Odell<p>Sir Philip is asked what would he like his legacy to be from BHS: “We can’t take away the sad ending and what has happened. If everyone wants to put the blame on me so be it.”</p><p>He then reels off a list of other things he has done in retail, mentioning that he has been the biggest supporter of the Retail Trust, a body that describes itself as on its website as a “wellbeing services that support all involved in retail and related industries”. He says he has spent many millions of pounds training young people in the industry and he says he supports a charity shop.</p>2:58pmMark Odell<p>He is asked whether he feels “hounded” and he replies: “Well I haven’t been able to visit my shops for 5 weeks” and goes on to say: “I made a bad call selling my business to [Mr Chappell's investment vehicle] . . . everyone wants to pick on Philip Green . . . I’m a big boy, i can take a punch on the chin . . . but I’m not lying . . .unfortunately I sold it to the wrong guy.”</p>3:00pmMark Odell<p>He is now being asked about tax avoidance mechanism he has employed:</p><p>“I have done nothing wrong . . . ,” he says, adding: “we have paid many, many hundreds of millions of pounds in tax . . . we could have employed many more aggressive mechanisms to avoid tax, we didn’t”</p>3:05pmMark Odell<p>Josephine Cumbo, the FT’s pension correspondent, has this reaction from the pension regulator to Sir Philip’s comments that he is working on a deal to sort out the BHS pension scheme:</p><p>https://twitter.com/JosephineCumbo/status/743079907547357186</p><p>https://twitter.com/JosephineCumbo/status/743080002342801408</p>3:07pmMark Odell<p>Ok so the meeting has ended after almost 6 hours but just before it was wrapped up Sir Philip said:</p><p>If there is someone who is interested in buying BHS. We will support anybody in making that happen. You can’t sell something that hasn’t received an offer”.</p>3:09pmMark Odell<p>And this from the FT’s chief political correspondent, Jim Pickard, as he heads out of the committee room (no doubt looking for some lunch):</p><p>Green is glad-handing MPs as they wrap up. “Cheer up – it may never happen,” he says to one. “I’m an honest guy,” he says reassuringly, as they are swept out of the room.</p>3:40pmMark Odell<p>We are wrapping up the live blog, please check FT.com for further coverage</p>",
